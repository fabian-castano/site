<h2>Bio</h2>

**Gilberto Ochoa Ruiz** is a researcher in **Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Internet of Things**. He has participated as associated researcher and lecturer in several programs accredited by the CONACYT PNPC program, geared around Computer Science and Communication and Information Technologies. He obtained a maser in **Computer Vision in Robotics** from [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/) and a **PhD in Computer Vision and Electronic Imaging** from the Universite de Bourgogne ([Laboratoire d'Imagerie et Vision Artificielle](https://imvia.u-bourgogne.fr/en/laboratory)) He is member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (SNI, Rank I) and of the CONACYT Network on Applied Computational Network (RedICA), the **Mexican Societies of IA (SMIA) and Computer Sc. (AMEXCOMP)**, as well as the **Latinx in AI** ([LXAI](https://www.latinxinai.org/)) Coalition. He as served as reviewer for ICLR, ICML, CVPR and IJCNN and as general chair of the **Latinx in Computer Vision Workshops** at [LXC @ CVPR](https://www.latinxinai.org/cvpr-2021-about) and [LXCV @ ICCV](https://www.latinxinai.org/iccv-2021) and as part of the organization or technical program committees of these efforts, as well as other conferences. He is part of the academic staff o the **Artificial Intelligence Hub** at **Tecnologico de Monterrey** and he became recently academic partner of the [Erasmus Mundus Master in Computational Colour and Spectral Imaging](https://cosi-master.eu/cosi-master-degree/). 

His research interests are focused on investigating and implementing novel algorithms and methods for applications in computer vision and medical image analysis. He has ample experience in the design and implementation of smart cameras on FPGA-based Systems-on-Chip for industrial applications (i.e. 3D scanners) at [Prefixa Vision Systems](https://www.prefixa.com/) and more recently he has become interested in developing optimized machine learning models for edge computing applications. 

<h2>Research Areas</h2>

<p> •	Artificial Intelligence (Computer vision and machine learning) for medical imaging</p> 
<p> •	Applied Computational Intelligence, Smart Connected Devices, AI at the edge</p> 
<p> •	Optimization techniques for designing edge AI models and devices.</p> 

<h2> Positions available/Grants </h2>
	
 There are available positions (bachelor, master and PhD) for all these projects via **CONACYT** (Mexican Council for Science and Technology) and other grants for suitable candidates (contact me for further details). International mobility is strongly encouraged and double diplomas are possible. 
I strongly advice any prospect students to show qualifications in machine deep learning if possible. Showing evidence of previous projects (thesis, articles, GitHub) or qualifications from Coursera (Deep Learning and/or Artificial Intelligence for Medicine) is highly desired.

 **Goal:** To develop new datasets, schemes and models for implement robust and real-time computer vision methods for Computer Integrated Surgery (CIS) applications and procedural quality assessment purposes

<h3> RECONDITE:  Deep learning and image analysis methods for improving the endoscopic identification of kidney stones composition </h3> 

In collaboration with [**Prof. Christian Daul**](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=XPH6u74AAAAJ&hl=fr) the [**Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy, CRAN (France)**](http://www.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/) and the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM)

**Goal:** To investigate deep learning algorithms for automatically classifying in vivo kidney stones from endoscopy images

<h3> PROTEUS: Endoscopic 3D View Enhancement and Automatic Categorization of Gastro-Intestinal Inflammations from Endoscopic data </h3>
